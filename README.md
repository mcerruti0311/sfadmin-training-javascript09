### Scripting with the DOM

### What You’ll Learn in This Hour:
* The concept of nodes
* The different types of nodes
* Using nodeName, nodeType, and nodeValue
* Using the childNodes collection
* Selecting elements with getElementsByTagName()
* How to use Mozilla’s DOM Inspector
* How to create new elements
* Ways to add, edit, and remove child nodes
* Dynamically loading JavaScript files
* Changing element attributes

You’ve already learned about the W3C DOM and, in the code examples of previous
hours, you used various DOM objects, properties, and methods.

In this hour you begin exploring how JavaScript can directly interact with the
DOM. In particular, you learn some new ways to navigate around the DOM,
selecting particular DOM objects that represent parts of the page’s HTML
contents. You see how to create new elements, how to add, edit, and remove nodes
of the DOM tree, and how to manipulate elements’ attributes.
